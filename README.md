Weekend Challenge **weekend-movie-sagas** from Prime Academy

## Description

*What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?*

In this assignment, I expanded an existing movie management application by introducing a detailed view for individual movies, complete with associated genres. The project involved setting up a relational database named `saga_movies_weekend` with tables and queries provided in the `database.sql` file. Leveraging React-Redux and Redux-Sagas, I enhanced the home/list page, allowing users to click on movie posters to navigate to a dedicated details page. On the details page, users can access comprehensive information about the selected movie, including title, description, image, and all associated genres. The implementation also considered the many-to-many relationship between movies and genres through the use of a junction table, `movies_genres`. While the base functionality did not require the persistence of movie details after a browser refresh, the overall solution prioritized an organized code structure, modular components, and adherence to React-Redux best practices.
